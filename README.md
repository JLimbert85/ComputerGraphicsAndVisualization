Computer Graphics and Visulization

## How do I approach designing software?
I start with a lot of planning. When doing these projects I have an objective I need to hit so I write it out and take time to break each goal into smaller objectives. That makes a larger project easier to handle. From there I start planning out how I will implement the smaller parts and put them together to create the final program. Starting with all this planning makes it much easier when it comes to coding. I already have a layout of what I need to do and can develop, test, and implement each part until I have a completed project. In my future work, whether working professionally or creating something on my own, I can use the same approach to make developing my projects simpler and well defined.

## How do I approach developing programs?
I like to work iteratively and build up programs piece by piece. By doing this I can fix mistakes early on and make a large program more manageable. For this project I started by creating each object in the scene individually on its own. I made the wall and desk first since they are the reference point for the size and placement of all the other objects. I then created each object individually, first getting the scale and placement correct for the overall object, and then iterating over it to add more complexity. Once all the objects were in place I then worked on adding textures, and eventually lighting.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
I believe that learning computer graphics and visualization has given me great skills for my future development. Having the understanding of how things are rendered on a screen, learning about coordinate systems and how to manipulate them with math, and learning about shaders can be useful for many applications. The majority of the programs that are developed these days have a graphical element to them. Having a solid understanding of how these elements work will make it much easier to create unique and interesting graphical elements for any future projects I work on.
